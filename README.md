### Spatial Rules Validator (QGIS + PostgreSQL/PostGIS)

QGIS plugin that executes spatial and semantic validation rules directly in PostgreSQL/PostGIS and consolidates detected inconsistencies into dedicated GIS layers for visual inspection and correction.  
Core focus: database-driven validation, scalability and reduction of manual GIS workflows.

Technologies: Python, QGIS API, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PL/pgSQL

### Participa Ouvidoria DF

Civic-tech platform for public issue reporting and citizen participation, integrating geolocation, backend APIs and structured data persistence.  
Designed with a focus on data integrity, spatial context and extensible backend architecture.

Technologies: Backend APIs, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, frontend application, Docker

### Skill Market Intel

Platform that analyzes job listings to extract and rank the most demanded technical skills for a given role.  
Emphasis on data ingestion, normalization and analytical pipelines rather than visualization.

Technologies: data ingestion, processing pipelines, analytical modeling

## Academic Work and Learning Repositories

This section groups university projects and learning-oriented repositories created during my academic and professional development.  
They are kept for reference and transparency, but do not represent my current production standards or architectural practices.

---

## Experimental and Future Projects

Repositories containing early-stage ideas, prototypes or technical explorations.  
These projects focus on experimentation and problem exploration rather than finished, production-ready solutions.
